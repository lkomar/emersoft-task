Welcome! This is my approach to the task I got from a great guy that wrote to me on LinkedIn 😁. I decided to give it a go since the stack looks quite awesome 🔥

## Launching the app locally

First, run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

If you want to run tests for the app, simply

```
yarn test
```
in the console.

If you want to see a coverage report for the tests, you can also run

```
yarn coverage
```
